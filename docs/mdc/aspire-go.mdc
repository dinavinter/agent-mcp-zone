 Note

This integration is part of the .NET Aspire Community Toolkit and isn't officially supported by the .NET Aspire team.

In this article, you learn how to use the .NET Aspire Go hosting integration to host Go applications.

Hosting integration
To get started with the .NET Aspire Go hosting integration, install the ðŸ“¦ CommunityToolkit.Aspire.Hosting.Go NuGet package in the AppHost project.

.NET CLI
PackageReference
.NET CLI

Copy
dotnet add package CommunityToolkit.Aspire.Hosting.Golang
For more information, see dotnet add package or Manage package dependencies in .NET applications.

Example usage
In the Program.cs file of your AppHost project, call the AddGolangApp method to add a Go application to the builder.

C#

Copy
var golang = builder.AddGolangApp("golang", "../gin-api")
    .WithHttpEndpoint(env: "PORT");
The PORT environment variable is used to determine the port the Go application should listen on. By default, this port is randomly assigned by .NET Aspire. The name of the environment variable can be changed by passing a different value to the WithHttpEndpoint method.

The Go application can be added as a reference to other resources in the AppHost project.
